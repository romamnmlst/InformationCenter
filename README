This android app has 3 modes: Map, Search, and Phone. In map mode, you can enter a latitude and longitude and view the coordinates in Google Maps. In search mode, you can enter a search term(s) and view the results in Google. In phone mode, you can enter a phone number, and dial it from your device. Pressing the logo returns the app to it's default state.

This app demonstrates the use of Google supplied intents, as well as my customization of various GUI elements.
